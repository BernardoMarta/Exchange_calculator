# Exchange Calculator

## Description

This is a Python program simulating a Coke vending machine, handling coin inputs and calculating change based on user denominations.

## Features

-   Supports only specific coin denominations (25, 10, and 5 cents).
-   Ensures accurate calculation of change and prevents invalid inputs.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Run the script:** Execute the Python script in a Python 3 environment.
2.  **Enter the product price:** When prompted, enter the price of the Coke you wish to purchase. The script will then display the amount due.
3.  **Insert coins:** Insert coins one at a time. The script only accepts 25, 10, and 5 cent coins.
4.  **Monitor the amount due:** After each valid coin insertion, the script will update the amount due and display it on the screen.
5.  **Receive your Coke and change:** Once you have inserted enough coins to cover the price, the script will calculate any change owed and display the amount. The program will then terminate.
